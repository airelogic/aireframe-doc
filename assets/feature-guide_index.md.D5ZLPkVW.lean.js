It is a self-contained environment that can be configured as the user requires. <ul><li>For more information on tenants, see the <a href="https://docs.identity.aireinnovate.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AireIdentity guide</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Subject</strong> - A subject is the entity that you are recording data about. This could be a patient, a citizen, a case, or any other entity that you need to record information about. <ul><li>Note, only a single subject type can be configured per tenant.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data Source</strong> - Data sources are where subject-related data is stored. We provide an internal data source where data is stored in the cloud, but you can also configure AireFrame to connect to external data sources.</li><li><strong>Subject Provider</strong> - The subject provider is the data source that provides the subjects and the organisation structure data to AireFrame.</li></ul>',9)]))}const f=t(i,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
